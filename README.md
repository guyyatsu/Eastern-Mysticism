# Eastern-Mysticism

## Igo
Igo, or Go to the West, is the oldest living game still being played in it's original form.  When it first came
to the West it was used as a tool for teaching morality to students of philosophy, but it has always been used
for that as well in the East along with teaching battle tactics to students of kenjutsu.

Interestingly, the game has a near-infinite complexity with the number of possible states reaching to around 100^200;
the depths of it's permutations have consistently resisted brute-force lookup table searching algorithms such as those used
by chess-playing algorithms for decades, and so far even the best go-playing algorithms can only perform at the level
of a moderately skilled human player at best.


## The Book of Changes.
The i-Ching is the Chinese Book of Changes; which describes a method of divinitory cleromancy as the
practically-applied teachings of the Eastern mystics.  The book consists of a table of the eight potential
three-digit combinations of Yin and Yang known as Trigrams, and the sixty-four Double-Trigrams called Hexagrams.

Each of the Eight Trigrams represents one of the classical elements of Eastern Mysticism:  
  - Qian(Heaven)
  - Dui(Lake)
  - Li(Fire)
  - Zhen(Thunder)
  - Xun(Wind)
  - Kan(Water)
  - Gen(Mountain)
  - Kun(Earth)
